# Guessing Game

A simple and fun guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Challenge your memory and see how many colors you can remember!

## Game Description

This is a guessing game where there are 4 colors. The game starts when any key is pressed. Initially, one color toggles, and the player must press the corresponding button. After pressing the correct color, another color toggles. The player then needs to press the first toggled color followed by the current one. The game continues with the player needing to remember and press the sequence of toggled colors in the correct order. If the player's guess is wrong, the game displays "game over."
